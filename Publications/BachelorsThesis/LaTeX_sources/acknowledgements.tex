This project is the milestone that represents the successful completion of my \emph{Degree in Telecommunication Technology and Service Engineering} at \emph{Universidad Aut\'{o}noma de Madrid}.

My four years as a student at \emph{Escuela Polit\'{e}cnica Superior}\footnote{\url{http://www.eps.uam.es/}} have given me the chance to meet very interesting people, at both a personal and professional level. All of my friends and family have been very kind and supportive from the beginning of this period, and our professors have always contributed to the highest degree of excellence in our studies.
Without all of you I surely would not be where I am sitting today.

I also want to express my most sincere gratitude to all the members at \emph{Grupo de Neurocomputaci\'{o}n Biol\'{o}gica}\footnote{\url{http://www.ii.uam.es/~gnb/}}, and in particular to my tutors \emph{Dr. Pablo Varona Mart\'{i}nez} and \emph{Dr. Francisco de Borja Rodr\'{i}guez}. Your excellence in research is a reference to me, and your enthusiastic guidance and constant support have been essential towards the success of this project.

Finally, I want to acknowledge the generous funding from the \emph{Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports} in the form of a \emph{2013/14 Collaboration Grant}\footnote{\url{https://sede.educacion.gob.es/catalogo-tramites/becas-ayudas-subvenciones/para-estudiar/grado/beca-colaboracion.html}}.
