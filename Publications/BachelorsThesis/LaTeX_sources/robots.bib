abstract = {In this paper a new general purpose perceptual control architecture, based on nonlinear neural lattices, is presented and applied to solve robot navigation tasks. Insects show the ability to react to certain stimuli with simple reflexes, using direct sensory-motor pathways, which can be considered as basic behaviors, inherited and pre-wired. Relevant brain centres, known as Mushroom Bodies (MB) and Central Complex (CX) were recently identified in insects: though their functional details are not yet fully understood, it is known that they provide secondary pathways allowing the emergence of cognitive behaviors. These are gained through the coordination of the basic abilities to satisfy the insect's needs. Taking inspiration from this evidence, our architecture modulates, through a reinforcement learning, a set of competitive and concurrent basic behaviors in order to accomplish the task assigned through a reward function. The core of the architecture is constituted by the so-called Representation layer, used to create a concise picture of the current environment situation, fusing together different stimuli for the emergence of perceptual states. These perceptual states are steady state solutions of lattices of Reaction-Diffusion Cellular Nonlinear Networks (RD-CNN), designed to show Turing patterns. The exploitation of the dynamics of the multiple equilibria of the network is emphasized through the adaptive shaping of the basins of attraction for each emerged pattern. New experimental campaigns on standard robotic platforms are reported to demonstrate the potentiality and the effectiveness of the approach.},

abstract = {New findings in the nervous system of invertebrates have shown how a number of features of central pattern generator (CPG) circuits contribute to the generation of robust flexible rhythms. In this paper we consider recently revealed strategies that living CPGs follow to design CPG control paradigms for modular robots. To illustrate them, we divide the task of designing an example CPG for a modular robot into independent problems. We formulate each problem in a general way and provide a bio-inspired solution for each of them: locomotion information coding, individual module control and inter-module coordination. We analyse the stability of the CPG numerically, and then test it on a real robot. We analyse steady state locomotion and recovery after perturbations. In both cases, the robot is able to autonomously find a stable effective locomotion state. Finally, we discuss how these strategies can result in a more general design approach for CPG-based locomotion.},

abstract = {Objective: To assess the feasibility and robustness of an asynchronous
and non-invasive EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for continuous
mental control of a wheelchair.
Methods: In experiment 1 two Subjects were asked to mentally drive both
a real and a simulated wheelchair from a starting point to a goal along
a pre-specified path. Here we only report experiments with the simulated
wheelchair for which we have extensive data in a complex environment
that allows a sound analysis. Each subject participated in five
experimental sessions, each consisting of 10 trials. The time elapsed
between two consecutive experimental sessions was variable (from 1 h to
2 months) to assess the system robustness over time. The pre-specified
path was divided into seven stretches to assess the system robustness in
different contexts. To further assess the performance of the
brain-actuated wheelchair, subject 1 participated in a second experiment
consisting of 10 trials where he was asked to drive the simulated
wheelchair following 10 different complex and random paths never tried
before.
Results: In experiment 1 the two subjects were able to reach 100\%
(subject 1) and 80\% (subject 2) of the final goals along the
pre-specified trajectory in their best sessions. Different performances
were obtained over time and path stretches, what indicates that
performance is time and context dependent. In experiment 2, subject 1
was able to reach the final goal in 80\% of the trials.
Conclusions: The results show that subjects can rapidly master our
asynchronous EEG-based BCI to control a wheelchair. Also.. they call
autonomously operate the BCI over long periods of time without the need
for adaptive algorithms externally tuned by a human operator to minimize
the impact of EEG non-stationarities. This is possible because of two
key components: first, the inclusion of a shared control system between
the BCI system and the intelligent simulated wheelchair; second, the
selection of stable user-specific EEG features that maximize the
separability between the mental tasks.
Significance: These results show the feasibility of continuously
controlling complex robotics devices using all asynchronous and
non-invasive BCI. (C) 2008 International Federation of Clinical

abstract = {Biped humanoid robots have gained much popularity in recent years.
These robots are mainly controlled by two major control methods,
the biologically-inspired approach based on Central Pattern Generator
(CPG) and the engineering-oriented approach based on Zero Moment
Point (ZMP). Given that flexibility in the body torso is required
in some human activities, we believe that it is beneficial for the
next generation of humanoid robots to have a flexible spine as humans
do. In order to cope with the increased complexity in controlling
this type of robot, a new kind of control system is necessary. Currently,
there is no controller that allows a flexible spine humanoid robot
to maintain stability in real-time while walking with dynamic spine
motions. This paper presents a new hybrid CPG-ZMP control system
for the walking of a realistically simulated flexible spine humanoid
robot. Experimental results showed that using our control method,
the robot is able to adapt its spine motions in real-time to allow
stable walking. Our control system could be used for the control
of the next generation humanoid robots.},

abstract = {This work presents a brain-computer interface (BCI) used to operate a robotic wheelchair. The experiments were performed on 15 subjects (13 of them healthy). The BCI is based on steady-state visual-evoked potentials (SSVEP) and the stimuli flickering are performed at high frequency (37, 38, 39 and 40Hz). This high frequency stimulation scheme can reduce or even eliminate visual fatigue, allowing the user to achieve a stable performance for long term BCI operation. The BCI system uses power-spectral density analysis associated to three bipolar electroencephalographic channels. As the results show, 2 subjects were reported as SSVEP-BCI illiterates (not able to use the BCI), and, consequently, 13 subjects (12 of them healthy) could navigate the wheelchair in a room with obstacles arranged in four distinct configurations. Volunteers expressed neither discomfort nor fatigue due to flickering stimulation. A transmission rate of up to 72.5bits/min was obtained, with an average of 44.6bits/min in four trials. These results show that people could effectively navigate a robotic wheelchair using a SSVEP-based BCI with high frequency flickering stimulation.},

abstract = {This paper presents a cooperative distributed approach for searching odor sources in unknown structured environments with multiple mobile robots. While searching and exploring the environment, the robots independently generate on-line local topological maps and by sharing them with each other they construct a global map. The proposed method is a decentralized frontier based algorithm enhanced by a cost/utility evaluation function that considers the odor concentration and airflow at each frontier. Therefore, frontiers with higher probability of containing an odor source will be searched and explored first. The method also improves path planning of the robots for the exploration process by presenting a priority policy. Since there is no global positioning system and each robot has its own coordinate reference system for its localization, this paper uses topological graph matching techniques for map merging. The proposed method was tested in both simulation and real world environments with different number of robots and different scenarios. The search time, exploration time, complexity of the environment and number of double-visited map nodes were investigated in the tests. The experimental results validate the functionality of the method in different configurations.},

@article{Yamashita2008,
abstract = {It is generally thought that skilled behavior in human beings results
from a functional hierarchy of the motor control system, within which
reusable motor primitives are flexibly integrated into various sensori-motor
sequence patterns. The underlying neural mechanisms governing the
way in which continuous sensori-motor flows are segmented into primitives
and the way in which series of primitives are integrated into various
behavior sequences have, however, not yet been clarified. In earlier
studies, this functional hierarchy has been realized through the
use of explicit hierarchical structure, with local modules representing
motor primitives in the lower level and a higher module representing
sequences of primitives switched via additional mechanisms such as
gate-selecting. When sequences contain similarities and overlap,
however, a conflict arises in such earlier models between generalization
and segmentation, induced by this separated modular structure. To
address this issue, we propose a different type of neural network
model. The current model neither makes use of separate local modules
to represent primitives nor introduces explicit hierarchical structure.
Rather than forcing architectural hierarchy onto the system, functional
hierarchy emerges through a form of self-organization that is based
on two distinct types of neurons, each with different time properties
("multiple timescales"). Through the introduction of multiple timescales,
continuous sequences of behavior are segmented into reusable primitives,
and the primitives, in turn, are flexibly integrated into novel sequences.
In experiments, the proposed network model, coordinating the physical
body of a humanoid robot through high-dimensional sensori-motor control,
also successfully situated itself within a physical environment.
Our results suggest that it is not only the spatial connections between
neurons but also the timescales of neural activity that act as important
mechanisms leading to functional hierarchy in neural systems.},

The objective is to control the direction of an electric wheelchair using only EEG signals. In other words, this is an attempt to use brain signals to control mechanical devices such as wheelchairs. To achieve this goal, we have developed a recursive training algorithm to generate recognition patterns from EEG signals. Our experimental results demonstrate the utility of the proposed recursive training algorithm and the viability of accomplishing direction control of an electric wheelchair by only EEG signals.},

abstract = {This article presents a new algorithm for search- ing odour sources across large search spaces with groups of mobile robots. The proposed algorithm is inspired in the par- ticle swarm optimization (PSO) method. In this method, the search space is sampled by dynamic particles that use their knowledge about the previous sampled space and share this knowledge with other neighbour searching particles allow- ing the emergence of efficient local searching behaviours. In this case, chemical searching cues about the potential exis- tence of upwind odour sources are exchanged. By default, the agents tend to avoid each other, leading to the emergence of exploration behaviourswhen no chemical cue exists in the neighbourhood. This behaviour improves the global search- ing performance.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a network of spiking neurons devoted to
navigation control. Three different examples, dealing with stimuli
of increasing complexity, are investigated. In the first one, obstacle
avoidance in a simulated robot is achieved through a network of spiking
neurons. In the second example, a second layer is designed aiming
to provide the robot with a target approaching system, making it
able to move towards visual targets. Finally, a network of spiking
neurons for navigation based on visual cues is introduced. In all
cases, the robot was assumed to rely on some a priori known responses
to low-level sensors (i.e., to contact sensors in the case of obstacles,
to proximity target sensors in the case of visual targets, or to
the visual target for navigation with visual cues). Based on their
knowledge, the robot has to learn the response to high-level stimuli
(i.e., range finder sensors or visual input). The biologically plausible
paradigm of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is included
in the network to make the system able to learn high-level responses
that guide navigation through a simple unstructured environment.
The learning procedure is based on classical conditioning.},

abstract = {A key challenge for neural modeling is to explain how a continuous
stream of multimodal input from a rapidly changing environment can
be processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of integrate-and-fire
neurons in real time. We propose a new computational model for real-time
computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms
based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not
require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead,
it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in
combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented
on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that
the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical
system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit
may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can
learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent
neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may
be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required
for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be
transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to
the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is
based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine,
that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions
between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as
the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict
universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for
the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing
of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for
the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and
data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in
robotics and neurotechnology.},

abstract = {Multiple extracellular microelectrodes (multi-electrode arrays, or MEAs) effectively record rapidly varying neural signals, and can also be used for electrical stimulation. Multi-electrode recording can serve as artificial output (efferents) from a neural system, while complex spatially and temporally targeted stimulation can serve as artificial input (afferents) to the neuronal network. Multi-unit or local field potential (LFP) recordings can not only be used to control real world artifacts, such as prostheses, computers or robots, but can also trigger or alter subsequent stimulation. Real-time feedback stimulation may serve to modulate or normalize aberrant neural activity, to induce plasticity, or to serve as artificial sensory input. Despite promising closed-loop applications, commercial electrophysiology systems do not yet take advantage of the bidirectional capabilities of multi-electrodes, especially for use in freely moving animals. We addressed this lack of tools for closing the loop with NeuroRighter, an open-source system including recording hardware, stimulation hardware, and control software with a graphical user interface. The integrated system is capable of multi-electrode recording and simultaneous patterned microstimulation (triggered by recordings) with minimal stimulation artifact. The potential applications of closed-loop systems as research tools and clinical treatments are broad; we provide one example where epileptic activity recorded by a multi-electrode probe is used to trigger targeted stimulation, via that probe, to freely moving rodents.doi: 10.3389/fnins.2010.00031},

cortical response evoked by repetitive stimuli with a light source
flickering at frequencies above 4 Hz and could be classified into
three ranges: low (up to 12 Hz), medium (12-30) and high frequency
(> 30 Hz). SSVEP-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) are principally
focused on the low and medium range of frequencies whereas there
are only a few projects in the high-frequency range. However, they
only evaluate the performance of different methods to extract SSVEP.METHODS:This
research proposed a high-frequency SSVEP-based asynchronous BCI in
order to control the navigation of a mobile object on the screen
through a scenario and to reach its final destination. This could
help impaired people to navigate a robotic wheelchair. There were
three different scenarios with different difficulty levels (easy,
medium and difficult). The signal processing method is based on Fourier
transform and three EEG measurement channels.RESULTS:The research
obtained accuracies ranging in classification from 65\% to 100\% with
Information Transfer Rate varying from 9.4 to 45 bits/min.CONCLUSIONS:Our
proposed method allows all subjects participating in the study to

nonlinear systems that are able to exhibit a wide variety of different

or chaotic spiking, regular or chaotic bursting, multistability,

are the result of the cooperative activity of many synaptically connected
neurons (a neuronal circuit). Thus, it is necessary to consider synchronization
between different neuronal circuits as well. (3) The synapses that
implement the coupling between neurons are also dynamical elements
and their intrinsic dynamics influences the process of synchronization
or entrainment significantly. In this review we will focus on four
new problems: (i) the synchronization in minimal neuronal networks
with plastic synapses (synchronization with activity dependent coupling),
(ii) synchronization of bursts that are generated by a group of nonsymmetrically
coupled inhibitory neurons (heteroclinic synchronization), (iii)
the coordination of activities of two coupled neuronal networks (partial
synchronization of small composite structures), and (iv) coarse grained
synchronization in larger systems (synchronization on a mesoscopic

@article{Edwards2007,
abstract = {The study of animal foraging behaviour is of practical ecological importance, and exemplifies the wider scientific problem of optimizing search strategies. L\'{e}vy flights are random walks, the step lengths of which come from probability distributions with heavy power-law tails, such that clusters of short steps are connected by rare long steps. L\'{e}vy flights display fractal properties, have no typical scale, and occur in physical and chemical systems. An attempt to demonstrate their existence in a natural biological system presented evidence that wandering albatrosses perform L\'{e}vy flights when searching for prey on the ocean surface. This well known finding was followed by similar inferences about the search strategies of deer and bumblebees. These pioneering studies have triggered much theoretical work in physics (for example, refs 11, 12), as well as empirical ecological analyses regarding reindeer, microzooplankton, grey seals, spider monkeys and fishing boats. Here we analyse a new, high-resolution data set of wandering albatross flights, and find no evidence for L\'{e}vy flight behaviour. Instead we find that flight times are gamma distributed, with an exponential decay for the longest flights. We re-analyse the original albatross data using additional information, and conclude that the extremely long flights, essential for demonstrating L\'{e}vy flight behaviour, were spurious. Furthermore, we propose a widely applicable method to test for power-law distributions using likelihood and Akaike weights. We apply this to the four original deer and bumblebee data sets, finding that none exhibits evidence of L\'{e}vy flights, and that the original graphical approach is insufficient. Such a graphical approach has been adopted to conclude L\'{e}vy flight movement for other organisms, and to propose L\'{e}vy flight analysis as a potential real-time ecosystem monitoring tool. Our results question the strength of the empirical evidence for biological L\'{e}vy flights.},

abstract = {Locating the source of an advected chemical signal is a common challenge facing many living organisms. When the advecting medium is characterized by either high Reynolds number or high Peclet number, the task becomes highly nontrivial due to the generation of heterogeneous, dynamically changing filamental concentrations that do not decrease monotonically with distance to the source. Defining search strategies that are effective in these environments has important implications for the understanding of animal behavior and for the design of biologically inspired technology. Here we present a strategy that is able to solve this task without the higher intelligence required to assess spatial gradient direction, measure the diffusive properties of the flow field, or perform complex calculations. Instead, our method is based on the collective behavior of autonomous individuals following simple social interaction rules which are modified according to the local conditions they are experiencing. Through these context-dependent interactions, the group is able to locate the source of a chemical signal and in doing so displays an awareness of the environment not present at the individual level. This behavior illustrates an alternative pathway to the evolution of higher cognitive capacity via the emergent, group-level intelligence that can result from local interactions.},

abstract ={When searching for food, many organisms adopt a superdiffusive, scale-free movement pattern called a Lévy walk, which is considered optimal when foraging for heterogeneously located resources with little prior knowledge of distribution patterns [Viswanathan GM, da Luz MGE, Raposo EP, Stanley HE (2011) The Physics of Foraging: An Introduction to Random Searches and Biological Encounters]. Although memory of food locations and higher cognition may limit the benefits of random walk strategies, no studies to date have fully explored search patterns in human foraging. Here, we show that human hunter–gatherers, the Hadza of northern Tanzania, perform Lévy walks in nearly one-half of all foraging bouts. Lévy walks occur when searching for a wide variety of foods from animal prey to underground tubers, suggesting that, even in the most cognitively complex forager on Earth, such patterns are essential to understanding elementary foraging mechanisms. This movement pattern may be fundamental to how humans experience and interact with the world across a wide range of ecological contexts, and it may be adaptive to food distribution patterns on the landscape, which previous studies suggested for organisms with more limited cognition. Additionally, Lévy walks may have become common early in our genus when hunting and gathering arose as a major foraging strategy, playing an important role in the evolution of human mobility.},

Recent studies of search in such environments model search behavior using random walks (e.g., Lévy walks) that match empirical movement distributions. We extend this modeling approach to include searcher responses to noisy sensory data. We explore the consequences of incorporating such sensory measurements into search behavior using simulations of a visual-olfactory predator in search of prey. Our results show that including even a simple response to noisy sensory data can dominate other features of random search, resulting in lower mean search times and decreased risk of long intervals between target encounters. In particular, we show that a lack of signal is not a lack of information. Searchers that receive no signal can quickly abandon target-poor regions. On the other hand, receiving a strong signal leads a searcher to concentrate search effort near targets. These responses cause simulated searchers to exhibit an emergent area-restricted search behavior similar to that observed of many organisms in nature.},

The particular example of pheromone communication considered here was inspired by queen bee pheromones that have a number of crucial functions in a bee colony, such as keeping together and stabilizing the colony. In the context of a robotic system, one of the proposed applications for robot pheromones is to allow a group of robots to be guided by a robot leader. The robot leader could release different chemicals to elicit a range of behaviors from other members of the group. A change of the operating temperature of tin oxide gas sensors has been implemented in order to differentiate different chemicals. This paper provides details of the robots used in the project and their behaviors. The sensors, especially the method of using the tin oxide gas sensors, the robot control algorithms and experimental results are presented. In this project, pheromones were used to trigger congregating behavior and light seeking in a group of robots.},

Motivated by the successful results of previous works capturing the odor from other parts of the body, this work attempts to evaluate the feasibility of identifying people by the odor emanated from the hands. By formulating this task according to a machine learning scheme, the problem is identified with a small-sample-size supervised classification problem in which the input data is formed by mass spectrograms from the hand odor of 13 subjects captured in different sessions. The high dimensionality of the data makes it necessary to apply feature selection and extraction techniques together with a simple classifier in order to improve the generalization capabilities of the model. Our experimental results achieve recognition rates over 85% which reveals that there exists discriminatory information in the hand odor and points at body odor as a promising biometric identifier. "

It enables the multi-robot system to search for the odor sources, which exist in the indoor environment, by imitating the forage behavior of the ant society. The modification of ACA includes new definitions of pheromone and heuristic function. And two extra search modes, local traversal search and global random search are added to improve the search performance of the robot system. A verification procedure is introduced into the iteration process to localize multiple odor sources. Simulation results have showed that the modified algorithm can effectively enable the robots to approach and determine the odor sources quickly and accurately.}

In this paper we consider recently revealed strategies that living CPGs follow to design CPG control paradigms for modular robots. To illustrate them, we divide the task of designing an example CPG for a modular robot into independent problems. We formulate each problem in a general way and provide a bio-inspired solution for each of them: locomotion information coding, individual module control and inter-module coordination. We analyse the stability of the CPG numerically, and then test it on a real robot. We analyse steady state locomotion and recovery after perturbations. In both cases, the robot is able to autonomously find a stable effective locomotion state. Finally, we discuss how these strategies can result in a more general design approach for CPG-based locomotion.}

But the precision can not be very high and artificial fish (AF) often suffers the problem of being trapped in local optima. Especially when the objective function is a multimodel function, this problem is more prominent. Since chaotic mapping enjoys certainty, ergodicity and stochastic property, chaotic search can serve as a kind of method for global optimization. Feedback can also act as a strategy to lead the movement of AF. In this paper, chaotic search and feedback strategy are introduced into AFSA to overcome the shortcoming above. The experimental results show that the improved AFSA can obtain better results than the standard AFSA.},

  ABSTRACT = {
  Localization is one of the fundamental problems in mobile robot navigation. Past experiments show that in general grid-based Markov localization is more robust than Kalman filtering while the latter can be more accurate than the former. Recently new methods for localization employing particle filters became popular. In this paper we compare different localization methods using Kalman filtering, grid-based Markov localization, Monte Carlo Localization (MCL), and combinations thereof. We give experimental evidence that a combination of Markov localization and Kalman filtering as well as a variant of MCL outperform the other methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and time needed for recovering from manual robot displacement, while requiring only few computational resources.

abstract={We present an application of hierarchical Bayesian estimation to robot map building. The revisiting problem occurs when a robot has to decide whether it is seeing a previouslybuilt portion of a map, or is exploring new territory. This is a difficult decision problem, requiring the probability of being outside of the current known map. To estimate this probability, we model the structure of a ”typical” environment as a hidden Markov model that generates sequences of views observed by a robot navigating through the environment. A Dirichlet prior over structural models is learned from previously explored environments. Whenever a robot explores a new environment, the posterior over the model is estimated using Dirichlet hyperparameters. Our approach is implemented and tested in the context of multi-robot map merging, a particularly difficult instance of the revisiting problem. Experiments with robot data show that the technique yields strong improvements over alternative methods.},

abstract={We describe the development of Centibots, a framework for very large teams of robots that are able to perceive, explore, plan and collaborate in unknown environments. The Centibots team currently consist of approximately 100 robots. The Centibots team can be deployed in unexplored areas, and can efficiently distribute tasks among themselves; the system also makes use of a mixed initiative mode of interaction in which a user can influence missions as necessary. In contrast to simulation-based systems which abstract away aspects of the environment for the purposes of exploring component technologies, the Centibots design reflects an integrated end-to-end system.}

  abstract={This paper presents a statistical algorithm for collaborative mobile robot localization. Our approach uses a sample-based version of Markov localization, capable of localizing mobile robots in an any-time fashion. When teams of robots localize themselves in the same environment, probabilistic methods are employed to synchronize each robot's belief whenever one robot detects another. As a result, the robots localize themselves faster, maintain higher accuracy, and high-cost sensors are amortized across multiple robot platforms. The technique has been implemented and tested using two mobile robots equipped with cameras and laser range-finders for detecting other robots. The results, obtained with the real robots and in series of simulation runs, illustrate drastic improvements in localization speed and accuracy when compared to conventional single-robot localization. A further experiment demonstrates that under certain conditions, successful localization is only possible if teams of heterogeneous robots collaborate during localization.}

    abstract = {<p>Polymorphism has fascinated evolutionary biologists since the time of Darwin. Biologists have observed discrete alternative mating strategies in many different species. In this study, we demonstrate that polymorphic mating strategies can emerge in a colony of hermaphrodite robots. We used a survival and reproduction task where the robots maintained their energy levels by capturing energy sources and physically exchanged genotypes for the reproduction of offspring. The reproductive success was dependent on the individuals' energy levels, which created a natural trade-off between the time invested in maintaining a high energy level and the time invested in attracting mating partners. We performed experiments in environments with different density of energy sources and observed a variety in the mating behavior when a robot could see both an energy source and a potential mating partner. The individuals could be classified into two phenotypes: 1) <italic>forager</italic>, who always chooses to capture energy sources, and 2) <italic>tracker</italic>, who keeps track of potential mating partners if its energy level is above a threshold. In four out of the seven highest fitness populations in different environments, we found subpopulations with distinct differences in genotype and in behavioral phenotype. We analyzed the fitnesses of the foragers and the trackers by sampling them from each subpopulation and mixing with different ratios in a population. The fitness curves for the two subpopulations crossed at about 25\% of foragers in the population, showing the evolutionary stability of the polymorphism. In one of those polymorphic populations, the trackers were further split into two subpopulations: (<italic>strong trackers</italic>) and (<italic>weak trackers</italic>). Our analyses show that the population consisting of three phenotypes also constituted several stable polymorphic evolutionarily stable states. To our knowledge, our study is the first to demonstrate the emergence of polymorphic evolutionarily stable strategies within a robot evolution framework.</p>},

    abstract = { A mobile robot needs to know its position and orientation with accuracy in order to decide the control actions that permit it to finish the entrusted tasks successfully. To obtain this information, dead-reckoning-based systems have been used, and more recently inertial navigation systems. However, these systems have some errors that grow bigger as time goes by, therefore a moment comes when the information provided is useless. Because of this, there should be a periodic process that updates the robot position and orientation of the vehicle. The process to determine the robot position and orientation by using information originated from the external sensors is defined as the mobile robot relocalization. It is obvious that the greater the frequency of this process, the better the knowledge of its position the robot will have, and therefore its movements will be better directed to the point it must reach. The algorithm to achieve this can be classified in two large groups: relocalization through an a priori map of the environment and relocalization through the detection of landmarks present in that environment. The algorithm presented in the paper belongs to the first case. The sensor used is a combination of a laser diode and a CCD camera. The sensorial information is modelled as straight lines that will be matched with an a priori map of the environment. With this, the position of the mobile robot is estimated. The matching process is accomplished within an extended Kalman filter. The algorithm is able to work in real time, and it actualizes the position of the robot in a continuous way. }

abstract={Localization is a key issue in multirobot formations, but it has not yet been sufficiently studied. In this paper, we propose a ceiling vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methodology for solving the global localization problems in multirobot formations. First, an efficient data-association method is developed to achieve an optimistic feature match hypothesis quickly and accurately. Then, the relative poses among the robots are calculated utilizing a match-based approach, for local localization. To achieve the goal of global localization, three strategies are proposed. The first strategy is to globally localize one robot only (i.e., leader) and then localize the others based on relative poses among the robots. The second strategy is that each robot globally localizes itself by implementing SLAM individually. The third strategy is to utilize a common SLAM server, which may be installed on one of the robots, to globally localize all the robots simultaneously, based on a shared global map. Experiments are finally performed on a group of mobile robots to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

abstract={Research topics in robotic application is quite varies but one of the most interesting topic is odor source
localization. This research combine the robot ability to recognize odor and track the movement so that robot

simulation software. This paper tries to verify the robustness of one of the localization method known as Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) in the real-world implementation. This paper will shows robot model that used in
the experiment and also discuss the architecture to implement robot behavior. A group of mobile robots equipped
with wireless communication device and odor sensors is employed. The experiment is conduct in area of 488cm
x 488cm with dynamic odor source in one end. The experiment also used a set of camera to track robots position.
The experiement result verifies that PSO is technically sound for real-world odor source localization. In this
experiment, PSO can localized the source in 360 seconds or bellow.},

  abstract={Bionic technology provides a new elicitation for mobile robot navigation since it
explores the way to imitate biological senses. In the present study, the challenging problem
was how to fuse different biological senses and guide distributed robots to cooperate with
each other for target searching. This paper integrates smell, hearing and touch to design an
odor/sound tracking multi-robot system. The olfactory robot tracks the chemical odor
plume step by step through information fusion from gas sensors and airflow sensors, while
two hearing robots localize the sound source by time delay estimation (TDE) and the
geometrical position of microphone array. Furthermore, this paper presents a heading
direction based mobile robot navigation algorithm, by which the robot can automatically
and stably adjust its velocity and direction according to the deviation between the current
heading direction measured by magnetoresistive sensor and the expected heading direction
acquired through the odor/sound localization strategies. Simultaneously, one robot can
communicate with the other robots via a wireless sensor network (WSN). Experimental
results show that the olfactory robot can pinpoint the odor source within the distance
of 2 m, while two hearing robots can quickly localize and track the olfactory robot
in 2 min. The devised multi-robot system can achieve target search with a considerable
success ratio and high stability.}
