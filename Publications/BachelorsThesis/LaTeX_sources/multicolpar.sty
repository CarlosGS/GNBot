%   This LaTeX style, writes different paragraphs in different columns
% the number of columns is free), as
%   This is the first paragraph  |  This is the second paragraph and its
%   and text follows...          |  own text follows...
%
%   This is the third paragraph  |  This is the fourth paragraph...
%   and text follows...          |
%
% This format is useful for translated articles, in which there is the
% original language in the first column and the translated version in
% the second.
%
% Usage: \begin{multicolpar}{N}
%         ... text ...
%        \end{multicolpar}
%
% where N is the number of columns in which the text will be displayed.
% Warning: Inside the environment, each blank line (ie a \par) will correspond
%          to a paragraph, therefore do not leave blank lines soon after the
%          \begin{multicolpar}{N} command and soon before the \end{multicolpar}
%          command (unless you want so).
