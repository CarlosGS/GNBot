  <description brief="vicon_bridge">

     This is a driver providing data from VICON motion capture systems. It is based on the vicon_mocap package from the starmac stacks. 
     Additionally, it can handle multiple subjects / segments and allows to calibrate an origin of the vehicle(s) as this is somehow tedious with the VICON Tracker.
